"This is pretty pale for a Tavel, with a coppery tinge to its pink color. Notes of lime zest, wet stone and modest cherry-berry notes finish on a bright citrus note."
"Mandarin-orange zest, cut Asian pear, lemon blossom and slight beeswax show on the fresh nose of this bottling by young winemaker Mike Callahan. It's extremely dry on the palate, like licking limestone, with hints of nectarine blossom and lemon-skin flavor."
